# Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCNs)

This project introduces a novel model: the Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network. The principal is to build a bridge between knowledge graphs and machine learning. KGCNs can be used to build vector representations or *embeddings* of any labelled set of Grakn concepts. As a result, they can be trained directly for classification or regression of Concepts stored in Grakn. Future work will include building embeddings via unsupervised learning.

### Coming Soon

This work is actively in-progress. Follow this repo for updates on the release, and [read more here](https://blog.grakn.ai/knowledge-graph-convolutional-networks-machine-learning-over-reasoned-knowledge-9eb5ce5e0f68).
