# KGCN Example - CITES Animal Trade Data

### Quickstart

**Requirements:**

- The requirements listed in the [KGCN quickstart](https://github.com/graknlabs/kglib/tree/master/kglib/kgcn#quickstart)
- The source code in order to access the example `git clone https://github.com/graknlabs/kglib.git`
- The `grakn-core-all-mac-animaltrade1.5.3.zip` dataset from the [latest release](https://github.com/graknlabs/kglib/releases/latest)
    - This is a dataset that has been pre-loaded into a distribution of Grakn 1.5.3 for Mac (this also works on Linux, but not on Windows). This data is pre-loaded so that you don't have to run the data import yourself. 
    - This Grakn distribution contains two keyspaces: `animaltrade_train` and `animaltrade_test`
- A Mac or Linux machine (only a requirement for this specific pre-loaded example dataset)

**To use:**

- Prepare the data:

  - If you already have an instance of Grakn running, make sure to stop it using `./grakn server stop`
  
  - Download `grakn-core-all-mac-animaltrade1.5.3.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/graknlabs/kglib/releases/latest). This is a Grakn distribution, pre-loaded with the CITES dataset

  - Unzip the distribution `unzip grakn-core-all-mac-animaltrade1.5.3.zip`, where you store this doesn't matter

  - cd into the distribution `cd grakn-core-all-mac-animaltrade1.5.3`
  
  - start Grakn `./grakn server start`

  - Confirm that the training keyspace is present and contains data 

    `./grakn console -k animaltrade_train`

    `match $t isa traded-item; get; limit 1;`

    and then `exit`

- Run the `main` function of the example: 

  Navigate to the root of the `kglib` repo: `cd kglib`

  Run the example: `python3 -m examples.kgcn.animal_trade.main`

  This will run the full pipeline: retrieving data, building and training a KGCN classifier

#### Details

The CITES dataset details exchanges of animal-based products between countries. In this example we aim to predict the value of `appendix` for a set of samples. This `appendix` can be thought of as the level of endangerment that a `traded-item` is subject to, where `1` represents the highest level of endangerment, and `3` the lowest.

The [main](../../../examples/kgcn/animal_trade/main.py) function will:

- Search Grakn for 30 concepts (with attributes as labels) to use as the training set, 30 for the evaluation set, and 30 for the prediction set using queries such as (limiting the returned stream):

  ```
  match $e(exchanged-item: $traded-item) isa exchange, has appendix $appendix; $appendix 1; get;
  ```

  This searches for an `exchange` between countries that has an `appendix` (endangerment level) of `1`, and finds the `traded-item` that was exchanged

- Save those labelled samples to file

- Delete all `appendix` attributes from both `animaltrade_train` and `animaltrade_test` keyspaces. This is the label we will predict in this example, so it should not be present in Grakn otherwise the network can cheat

- Search Grakn for the k-hop neighbours of the selected examples, and store information about them as arrays, denoted in the code as `context_arrays`. This data is saved to file so that subsequent steps can be re-run without recomputing these data

- Build the TensorFlow computation graph using `model.KGCN`, including a multi-class classification step and learning procedure defined by `classify.SupervisedKGCNMultiClassSingleLabelClassifier`

- Feed the `context_arrays` to the TensorFlow graph, and perform learning

##### Re-training the model
Re-running the `main` function will make use of the `feed_dicts` previously saved to file (at `dataset/10_concepts/input`), and so will repeat `classifier.train(feed_dicts[TRAIN])`, `classifier.eval(feed_dicts[EVAL])` and `classifier.eval(feed_dicts[PREDICT])` over the exact same data as previously retrieved. Therefore, to play with the learning parameters, do so and then simply re-run `main`.

##### Re-generating the `feed_dicts`
To re-generate the `feed_dicts`, delete the saved files in `dataset/10_concepts/input`.

##### Picking new samples
To pick different sample concepts to use for training/evaluation/prediction you need to:
- Force the `feed-dict`s to re-generate by deleting the saved files (as above)
- Use a fresh version of `grakn-core-all-mac-animaltrade1.5.3`, since the present one has had the supervised labels deleted!
